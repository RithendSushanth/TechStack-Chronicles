## 1. Introduction

- **Independence:** This document outlines the technical implementation of a video transcoding pipeline, detailing its architecture, components, data design, security considerations, and other technical aspects.
- **Scope**: The pipeline includes handling user-uploaded videos, transcoding them, and securely storing the results, with a focus on scalability and error management.

## 2. System Architecture

- **Overview**: The system converts user-uploaded videos to different formats or qualities using a transcoding service, ensuring scalability, security, and high throughput.
- **Components**:
    - **S3 Buckets**: Temporary storage for incoming videos and a result bucket for transcoded videos.
    - **SQS Queue**: Handles messaging between components.
    - **Docker Container**: Runs the transcoding service.
    - **Transcoding Service**: Responsible for converting video formats.
    
### Interactions:
1. Users upload videos to the **Temporary S3 Bucket**.
2. A message is sent to **SQS Queue** with video metadata.
3. The **Transcoding Service** processes the video from the S3 bucket.
4. The transcoded video is uploaded to the **Result S3 Bucket**.
5. In case of failure, the process retries or logs the error.

## 3. Component Design

### 3.1 Upload Video to Temporary S3 Bucket
- **Responsibilities**: Handle video uploads from users and store them in a temporary S3 bucket for processing.
- **Interactions**: 
    - User -> Temporary S3 Bucket.

### 3.2 Send SQS Message
- **Responsibilities**: After upload, send video details (e.g., location, format) to the SQS queue.
- **Interactions**: 
    - Temporary S3 Bucket -> SQS Queue.

### 3.3 Transcoding Service
- **Responsibilities**: Continuously listens for new messages in the SQS queue, retrieves the video, transcodes it, and stores the output.
- **Interactions**: 
    - SQS Queue -> Docker Container -> Transcoding Service.

### 3.4 Upload Transcoded Video to Result S3 Bucket
- **Responsibilities**: Store the transcoded video in the final S3 bucket.
- **Interactions**: 
    - Transcoding Service -> Result S3 Bucket.

### 3.5 Handle Failed Transcoding
- **Responsibilities**: If transcoding fails, retry the process or log the failure.
- **Interactions**: 
    - Transcoding Service -> SQS Queue (for retries or failure logging).

## 4. Data Design

### 4.1 S3 Bucket Structure
- **Temporary S3 Bucket**: Stores original videos temporarily before transcoding.
- **Result S3 Bucket**: Stores transcoded videos.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use UUIDs or user IDs combined with timestamps to avoid naming conflicts.

### 4.2 SQS Message Format
- **Fields**:
    - Video location (S3 path)
    - Video format
    - User ID
    - Transcoding status
- **Example Message**:
    ```json
    {
        "videoId": "12345",
        "videoPath": "/temp/12345.mp4",
        "userId": "user123",
        "status": "pending"
    }
    ```

## 5. Security Considerations

### 5.1 Data Protection
- **At Rest**: S3 buckets use encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) to protect data.
- **In Transit**: Secure communication using HTTPS between components.

### 5.2 Access Control
- **S3 Buckets**: Restrict access using IAM roles.
- **SQS Queue**: Ensure only the Transcoding Service can access the queue.
  
### 5.3 Compliance
- Adhere to **GDPR** or **HIPAA** requirements for data protection and user privacy.

## 7. API Documentation

### 7.1 Endpoints
- **/upload**: POST endpoint to upload videos.
- **/status**: GET endpoint to check transcoding status.

### 7.2 Requests and Responses
- **Upload Video (POST /upload)**:
    ```json
    {
        "userId": "user123",
        "videoFile": "file.mp4"
    }
    ```
- **Response**:
    ```json
    {
        "videoId": "12345",
        "status": "uploaded"
    }
    ```

## 8. Error Handling and Logging

### 8.1 Error Handling
- Implement retries for failed transcoding and alert the user if processing fails.

### 8.2 Logging
- **Logs**: Store transcoding errors and user interactions (S3 logs, CloudWatch, etc.).

## 9. Deployment Plan

### 9.1 Environment Setup
- Setup environments (development, staging, production) on AWS with proper IAM roles and permissions.

### 9.2 Deployment Steps
1. Build and push Docker containers.
2. Deploy transcoding services.
3. Set up S3 buckets and SQS queues.
4. Configure monitoring and alerting (CloudWatch).
